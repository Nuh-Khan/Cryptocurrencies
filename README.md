# Cryptocurrency Investment Portfolio Analysis

This repository contains a project that aims to analyze the cryptocurrency market for creating a new investment portfolio. The project uses unsupervised learning techniques to process, cluster, and visualize cryptocurrency data to classify and better understand the vast universe of cryptocurrencies.

## Project Overview

The project consists of four main parts:

1. **Part 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA** - The cryptocurrency data will be preprocessed to fit the machine learning models, including cleaning, transforming, and scaling the data.
2. **Part 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA** - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) will be applied to reduce the data dimensions and extract the most relevant features from the dataset.
3. **Part 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means** - K-means clustering algorithm will be used to group cryptocurrencies based on their similarities and create a classification system for the new investment portfolio.
4. **Part 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results** - The results of the clustering will be visualized using various data visualization techniques to effectively communicate the findings.
